	Description:

	function. Tested and functioning on all Air and Land Vehicles, including UAV's (you must be the
	driver/operator).
	
	Place this script in directory...
	\server\functions\purchaseFuelInit.sqf
	
	Edit the file...
	\server\init.sqf
	
	And at the bottom of the script, paste in...
	[] execVM "server\functions\purchaseFuelInit.sqf";

	COPY/MOVE the 'purchaseFuel.paa' (icon) into the directory...
	\client\icons\purchaseFuel.paa
	
	*Please note that with the use of this script, that 'Jerry Cans' will still be able to filled
	for FREE.
	
	Parameter(s): none

	Example: none
	
	Change Log:
	1.0.0 -	original base script.
	1.0.1 -	updated purchase fuel action with custom icon. (made by soulkobk to match other
			A3Wasteland icons).
